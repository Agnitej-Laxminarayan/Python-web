Introduction

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace (Indentation). It's widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence, due to its extensive standard library and supportive community.

Python is considered one of the easiest languages to learn because it has many built-in functions. Unlike C or C++, Python is primarily an interpreted language rather than a compiled language. This means Python code is executed line by line, allowing for more interactive and flexible programming, which simplifies debugging and development.

.. note::
   Indentation in Python is a fundamental aspect of the language's syntax and plays a crucial role in defining the structure and flow of the code.
   Unlike many other programming languages that use braces {} or keywords to delimit blocks of code, Python uses indentation to signify code blocks, such as those following loops, conditionals, functions, and class definitions. 



.. note::
    Lists,tuples,dictionaries,sets and range will be later covered in detail in a seperate topics individually. If any of these concepts appears before any explanation try to understand, if not then nothing to be worried.
